This is a document designed to do two things: 
  1) Serve as a schedule/roadmap of sorts for the app.
  2) Handle day-to-day documentation and tasks accomplished, keeping track of what was done and when it was done.
  
Objectives:
"(1) each day has its own page
(2) each state listed seperately
(3) broken down by city
(4) listing all venues-per-city
(5) bands-per-city
(6) promoters/bookers-per-city
(7) it becomes a consolidated reference guide
(8) with data from the DB's
(9) the new viral data
(10) and essentially one just needs to glance the day of tour they're working on here
(11) and they have all the emails
(12) facebook page links
(13) bandcamp links
(14) and perhaps even history of our activity in the region
(15) successes/ failures."
 
Overall class structures:
  -TourDate class
  -Data Center class
  -State class 
  -City class
  -Contacts class
  	>Bands class
  	>Bookers class
  -Venues class

All classes will have a "store" and "pull" function to add or view data from Google Sheets.

  -Basic class attributes mentioned in objectives

3/20/2018
  -Added signature, documentation, and commentary to all active modules
  -Added datacenter.py as a general management object to handle all active objects and act as the link to Google
  -Added database-like qualities to state.py, city.py, venue.py, and datacenter.py
